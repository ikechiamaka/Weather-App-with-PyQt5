sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 python3-requests
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit
sudo pip3 install Flask


1. Initial Setup:
1.1. Operating System:
Ensure you have Raspbian OS (or Raspberry Pi OS) installed on your Raspberry Pi. If not, you can download it from the official site.

1.2. SSH (optional):
If you're working remotely, enable SSH on your Pi:

Open terminal on your Pi and run:

	sudo raspi-config

Navigate to Interface Options > SSH and enable it.

Now you can access your Raspberry Pi remotely using SSH.

2. Installing Required Packages:
2.1. Update and Upgrade:
Before installing anything, always update and upgrade:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2.2. Install PyQt5:

	sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
	sudo apt install python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit

2.3. Install Flask:
	sudo pip3 install Flask

2.4. Install Requests:

	sudo pip3 install requests

3. Set Up Your Project:

3.1. Flask Template:
Make sure you have a templates folder in the same directory as your Flask app. Inside this folder, place your map.html file, so Flask can find and render it.

4. Running the Application:
4.1. Start Flask:
Navigate to the directory where your Flask app is:

	cd /path/to/your/app

Then, run the Flask app:

	python3 app.py

This will start Flask, and it will be accessible from any device on your network using the Raspberry Pi's IP address followed by :5000.

4.2. Start the PyQt Application:
On the Raspberry Pi, navigate to your project folder and run:

	python3 PyQtAPP_RPI.py

This will launch your PyQt application.
